* TODO: For some reason the "Polygon -> Finish" action does not work in the `EditControl`. There a also some issues with other actions (not modes, they are OK)

OLD TODO:

* Add a legend control (see https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/search_control.html#example for inspiration)
* Add a geosearch control (see e.g. https://github.com/smeijer/leaflet-geosearch)
* Add TimeDimension control and objects (see https://github.com/socib/Leaflet.TimeDimension)
