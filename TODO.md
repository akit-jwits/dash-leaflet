* TODO: For some reason the "Polygon -> Finish" action does not work in the `EditControl`

TODO

* Check that things work
* LOOK INTO MAP EVENT SUBSCRIPTION STUFF, e.g. 

// events are fired when entering or exiting fullscreen.
map.on('enterFullscreen', function(){
  console.log('entered fullscreen');
});

* Consider the new design. Is it better? Should imports be reduced more?

TODO:

* Add a legend control (see https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference/search_control.html#example for inspiration)
* Add a geosearch control (see e.g. https://github.com/smeijer/leaflet-geosearch)
* Add TimeDimension control and objects (see https://github.com/socib/Leaflet.TimeDimension)
